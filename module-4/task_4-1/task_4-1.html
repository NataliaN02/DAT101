      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented development is important because it allows programmers to model real-world entities using objects, making code easier to organize, reuse, and maintain. It helps manage complexity by bundling data and behavior together.</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The static object "AccountType" holds a set of predefined account types. It is used to standardize values and avoid mistakes like typos. This helps in software development by making code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation is used to hide the internal details of a class and control access to its data. This prevents external code from accidentally modifying important internal values. In JavaScript, we can create private members using # (e.g., #balance) and public members by just defining them without #.</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>Using new in JavaScript creates a new object based on a constructor function or class. It sets up a new instance, assigns this to that object, runs the constructor code, and returns the new object automatically.</p>
