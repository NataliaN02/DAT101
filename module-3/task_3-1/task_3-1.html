      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the if statement is completed by the condition wakeUpTime == 7, it stands true if the value 7 was assigned to the variable wakeUpTime, and thus the code inside the if block is executed - "I can take the bus to school." is printed to the output. If the value of the variable wakeUpTime is different than 7, the if statement stands false, and thus the code is not executed - nothing is printed to the output.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. However the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the variable wakeUpTime equals 7, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints "I can take the bus to school." to the output. However in this case, if the condition of the if statement is not met (i.e., wakeUpTime is not equal to 7), the code inside the else block is executed instead, which prints "I have to take the car to school." to the output.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>This time a new condition is added by the else if statement, which executes the code within its block whenever the value of wakeUpTime equals 8 - "I can take the train to school." is printed to the output. In this case the code inside the else block is executed, when the value of wakeUpTime is neither equal to 7 nor 8. </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the variable called number is greater than 0, the code within the if block is executed and the output stands "Positive", because integers greater than 0 are positive. If number is less than 0, the code within the else if block is executed and the output stands "Negative", because integers less than 0 are negative. If number is exactly 0, nothing prints out to the output, because 0 is an integer that is neither positive nor negative.</p>
